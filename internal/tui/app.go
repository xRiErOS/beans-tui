// already reached the running program -- i.e. long after this assignment)
// can reach the SAME *tea.Program the initial watchMsg closure already
// captures directly by value, without threading p itself through
// model/Update. A package-level var is safe here specifically because
// nothing else that could invoke it (switchRepoCmd's notify is only ever
// invoked from a watcher goroutine started by a repo switch, itself only

// repoDir is then ignored, there is deliberately no repo to watch yet -- the
// PO's first switchRepoCmd dispatch (keyLobby, view_lobby.go) supplies the
